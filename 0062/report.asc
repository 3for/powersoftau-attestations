Hey there,

I have completed my part of the Powers of Tau ceremony and below is the response file hash:

3a8ae5be 6e4e15c8 23021c27 10cba9ab
aef44fc9 fa4f577b 70789ec6 b4bfc867
98c39258 0d6f8e86 f6367779 1750b4fc
5962ca04 0962f2d3 7a402233 aff8184c

I downloaded the challenge file and transferred it to a USB drive. I had an old laptop that should have been scrapped a long time so I used that as my hardware and I also removed the Wi-Fi card from it. I imaged the drive with a fresh copy of Windows 7 x64, never connected to any network. I setup the software and did a test challenge/response. The machine was then placed in a faraday cage with 220v power supply onboard a vessel (think multiple layers of steel) until I came with the USB drive & challenge file. I loaded the laptop with the challenge file and setup a task in task scheduler to run the computation. When the vessel was at sea in international waters the computation process started and completed. The response file was then transferred to a USB drive and the laptop was lost at sea.

Regards,

Quentin Roberts
