Notes:

This is my second participation.

* Hardware is a Rock64 single board computer that has been purchased online
this week.  I never connected it to any network.
* OS was a somewhat older ayufan Debian Jessie minimal distribution
obtained from
https://github.com/ayufan-rock64/linux-build/releases/tag/0.5.15.
    c9e8f3f7304cab569ab5c0be9fd72897eb76103d2fb8089cf64b2239fa740262
jessie-minimal-rock64-0.5.15-136-arm64.img.xz
* Compute binary was compiled on another ARM64 device.  The binary
sha256sum is
7af00728c651f6c0fe77eb8863dd9638f72232b9aaaf8facb5676999111ed7c9.  The
binary was archived for future research.
* The boot drive was on an SD card.  The Jessie distribution was downloaded
and imaged on the SD card and then archived.
* The challenge was copied to the device using an sdcard connected through
a Transcend SD card adapter
* Additional entropy was injected into /dev/random via keyboard mashing and
dice throws with `stty -echo`
* The device was on a UPS which was disconnected from AC throughout the
computation
* The device was connected to a display and keyboard during the computation
* No swap was configured
