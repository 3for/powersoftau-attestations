Powers of Tau Attestation

Gibson Ashpool

USA


Purchased four core2duo PC's with cash from someone on Craigslist over a year ago for another project but they have been collecting dust for months now so figured they are good candidates for powers of tau.  

TAU machine specs:

Dell Optiplex 330

Intel Core2duo

2GB ddr2 Kensington RAM

80GB HDD


To start preparing I wiped the HDD with DBAN eraser. Ran memtests via live CD and then installed Lubuntu 16.04. 


Ran following commands via terminal:

> sudo curl -sSF https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh

> sudo apt-get install git

I downloaded the challenge file on a seperate PC, then transferred the challenge file to the compute PC via USB stick.

> git clone https://github.com/ebfull/powersoftau

Plugged in USB stick and copied challenge file into powersoftau directory

> cd powersoftau

> cargo run --release --bin compute

It ran for a short time then when prompted for entropy, added long random string of text. I then asked my daughter to enter random keys while I didnt look, to which she replied "Really? Just press the keys?" and I replied "Press as many as you want, just dont press the enter key" she then pressed random keys for about 15 seconds and when she was done I instructed her to hit the enter key. I then turned back to the terminal to see "reading challenge into memory, Computing, this could take awhile" in the terminal. It was getting late so I put her to bed, grabbed a beer and watched TV, checking back every 15mins or so.

Compute took almost 2hrs

Copyed response file to USB stick and transferred to other PC, then uploaded response file to AWS server

Powered down PC, removed two RAM sticks and HDD. Destroyed RAM and HDD with power tools.

I then performed full format on USB stick.
