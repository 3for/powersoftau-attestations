## Hardware used:

Hardware:
ASRock h81 Pro BTC r2.0
Pentium G4400
RAM Kingstom 4GB DDR4
Standard keyboard RT6856T (year 1996)
Ubuntu server 16.04
USB drive 16GB




## Procedure for computation:

I performed the computation on a machine created especially for this
occasion.

The hardware was selected randomly from a refurbished warehouse, than
i covered the hardware with an aluminum case, created by hand.

I ran everything from my basement, where there is no signal and no
networks, no mobile devices was with me.

Additional entropy was added before computation


When the process is finished I saved the response in a USB drive and
removed all the USB storage

So, after disassembling the machine I destroyed it, while the usb
storage has been overwritten 2 times with random numbers with the dd
tool and destroyed


I made 2 copies of the response and uploaded one from another location.
