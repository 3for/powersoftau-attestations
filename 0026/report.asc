Powers of Tau Operational Write-up
=================================
Round: 26

Response (BLAKE2b):

Procedure
=================================

I performed the challenge concurrently on two separate computers and following the roll of a dice chose to upload one of them. Machine 1 was a 2017-built Hackintosh running macOS High Sierra 10.13.2. Machine 2 was running Windows 10 Home and has been in my possession for several years.

I performed a similar approach on both machines, firstly downloading rust. On the Hackintosh this was achieved via Homebrew and on the Windows machine by downloading directly from rust-lang.org. Both machines were running the latest stable release of 1.22.1. On running the challenge on the Windows machine I encounter a link.exe error which necessitated the additional downloading of Visual Studio to fix and successfully run the challenge.

I downloaded the challenge file from the S3 link provided by Sean Bowe and used git to clone the powersoftau repo with commit d47a1d3d1f007063cbcc35f1ab902601a8b3bd91. 

Side Channel Defences
=================================

Entropy sources: For each machine, I chose a book from my library and randomly selected words from each. My typing is terrible, so a number were misspelt which I did not correct. In addition, I then performed an obligatory “mashing of the keyboard”  for added randomness.

Physical/electronic monitoring: I didn’t perform anything specific in this regard albeit the challenge was performed concurrently on two machines. Both computers were located in my basement and watched throughout by myself and dog who, albeit slept through the majority of the process, did not raise any alarms regarding physical intruders.

Postprocessing
=================================

As above once both challenges were complete I rolled a dice (assigning odd numbers to one computer and even to another) and uploaded the corresponding chosen response. I have no intention to destroy either machine, but both machines were shut down following completion of the challenge.
