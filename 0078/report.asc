Notes:

* Hardware is an Intel laptop that has not been powered up in four years
and has never been connected to a network after it was purchased.  CPU was
a Celeron 1007U.  Wireless card was removed.
* OS was a clean Ubuntu 14.04
* Compute binary was created with a deterministic Gitian build, with report
here:
https://github.com/devrandom/golang-powersoftau/commit/241da6dac6166a68ff20ef7abbb0f8231a626a3c.
The binary sha256sum is
c28894877c8948960eaefa0d8f35da6c911031980672b983f361711a7dcb1ec8.  The
binary was archived for future research.
* A USB drive was purchased in person and used to transfer the binary and
challenge into the laptop and the response out of the laptop.
* Additional entropy was injected into /dev/random via keyboard mashing and
dice throws
* The laptop was disconnected from AC throughout the computation
* The boot drive was destroyed
