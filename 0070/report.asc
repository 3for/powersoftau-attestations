Preparation steps
=================

Zcash FR Team is currently compose of 3 members. Each member brings is own computer prepared by himself. We did not talk to each other which preparation was made neither which software or version was installed.

Sidechannel Defences
====================

The computing process was done in the flat of a Zcash FR Team member. In this flat there was the 3 members of Zcash FR Team and nobody else.
Computing was done offline.

Procedure
=========

We start with 3 computers ready to compute. For convenience reason we needed to use 1 computer so we took 1 computer at random and get it off the computing process.

Then we downloaded the challenge file on the 2 computers selected to participate.

The text entered to provide additional entropy was different on the 2 computers.
It was composed of :
- - - Random type
- - - Name of Zcash FR Team members
- - - Information display on TV channel
- - - Play card picked randomly


After the response file was generated on both computer we decided to play a video game to decide which response file will be send. The winner send is own response file.


The BLAKE2b hash of `./response` is:
        9298f7b3 31daa220 55c31fae 4564ca59
        33e0a1ce 6861c92d 33d755bc 4a68756d
        6b1c6f78 7a2c4a1a 53681f2b b4026ece
        350bb618 d8a9f847 2b18ddc2 ce117865
