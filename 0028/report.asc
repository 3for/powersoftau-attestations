Powers of Tau Operational Writeup, Round 28
===========================================

SuperKerem
25 December 2017
London, United Kingdom

1 x MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (and Secure Enclave)
1 x iPod (no camera/mic/wireless)
3 x USB Flash Drive

Entropy sources were magazines and literature from years ago.
Unintentional typing errors were present and left uncorrected.


Procedure
===========================================

All wireless base stations were powered off and unplugged.
An undisclosed live operating system was validated by a hash function and copied to Flash Drive 1.
The Rust standalone installer, dependencies and challenge file were validated by a hash function and copied to Flash Drive 2.

1. The computer and iPod (playing the latest XXXTentacion album on repeat) were carried into a storage room containing no other electronics.
2. Flash Drive 1 was inserted and the live operating system was booted.
3. Flash Drive 2 was inserted and the Rust standalone installer, dependencies and challenge file were copied and installed (where applicable).
4. Flash Drive 2 was removed.
5. The response file was computed and copied to Flash Drive 3.

Following completion, the computer was powered off and left for 15 minutes.
Wireless base stations were then powered on, the response file was uploaded and all flash drives were securely overwritten.
