Powers of Tau Operational Write-up
=============================

Round: 9

Date: 2017-11-18

Name: Robert Hackett

Location: New York, NY

Response (blake2b): 2af8b7aadedc27d194a28cb67729f8cab0095a48a8406c071f097639d852c4917ecf213194df2115dd0a294b9c114711237f041c37987023dd8c9f4bc42991d9

Procedure
=================

I downloaded the challenge file from an Amazon S3 bucket set up by Sean Bowe. I computed a response locally using rustc 1.21.0 on a non-air-gapped MacBook Pro from mid-2012 running macOS High Sierra. I uploaded the response file to the same Amazon S3 bucket.

Side channel defenses
=================

Entropy source: A literary excerpt of undisclosed provenance.

Physical/electronic monitoring: All steps performed from the comfort of my living room.  I played aloud the new Spoon album Hot Thoughts on a separate laptop while it computed. 

I have no intention to destroy the compute node.
