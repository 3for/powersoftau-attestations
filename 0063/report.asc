Hello everyone,

Below is my powers of tau attestation. I did the computation neither from
my primary work place or home but a different location. During the entire
computation I’ve kept the laptop that I’ve been running it on in the room
with me. Before starting I rebooted the machine. I rolled the dice a few
dozen times and recorded the numbers which I then fed as additional entropy
to urandom. I downloaded and compiled the FiloSottile’s go implementation
and executed it. I rebooted my laptop after the
computation.
