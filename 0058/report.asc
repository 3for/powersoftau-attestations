## General sidechannel defenses:


# Contacted Sean Bowe using Whonix who forwarded my message to Jason Davies.

# Always communicated using Tor to prevent an adversary from obtaining my geographical location prior to the computation.

# Computation was done in an empty room in my home's basement. All unnecessary electronic devices were kept outside the ceremony room (including my phone which was additionally wrapped in tinfoil). I was the only person in the house at the time. Necessary Ethernet connections were made via 50 m cable to my server room upstairs. I was in the ceremony room the whole time.



## Preparation a few days prior to computation day: 


# Purchased a used desktop PC with cash from a stranger and removed the HDD. No Wifi equipment was present at the machine.

# Drove to a friend of mine and downloaded a fresh Ubuntu 17.04 x64 DVD image via his machine running Linux Mint 17.04 as OS.

# Verified the image via the hash provided on the Ubuntu homepage and wrote it to a raw DVD.

# At home I booted up the Powers of Tau computation machine with the Ubuntu live DVD and built the compute binary which was then saved on a newly purchased USB drive. The USB drive was put into a safe.



## Procedure on computation day:


# Booted a second machine (notebook) with the Ubuntu live DVD, downloaded and installed Tor Browser and retrieved the challenge file via Tor.

# Copied the challenge file onto the USB drive which already contained the compute binary.

# Powered down the notebook and booted the Powers of Tau computation machine with the same Ubuntu live DVD. 

# On computation machine first rust was installed and then Ethernet removed.

# Plugged in USB drive and started computation via Terminal.



## Computation ceremony:


# Entropy was generated by entering a random string in addition to 100 numbers generated by a roulette wheel.

# Computation took about one and a half hours.

##############



## Postprocessing:


# Saved the BLAKE2b hash on the USB drive and powered down the computation machine.

# Booted notebook again with Ubuntu live DVD, downloaded and installed Tor Browser.

# Plugged in the USB drive containing the response file.

# Uploaded response file via Tor to AWS machine.

# Wrote this report on a second notebook which was used to initially contact Sean Bowe while the response file was uploading on the first notebook which was used in the ceremony.

# Mailed this report to Jason Davies

# Nuked the USB drive via DBAN.
